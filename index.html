    <h2>Is there a nurses shortage in the UK?</h2>
    <p>According to Royal College of Nursing there are approximately 40000 registered nurses vacancies only in England
      <span class="sup"><a href="#ref1">1</a></span>.
      Data for other UK nations is not
      available. <br>
      Data from Health Foundation shows that UK has fewer nurses relative to the population than the OECD average, and
      it is also below many EU countries <span class="sup"><a href="#ref2">2</a></span>.</p>

    <h3>NMC Register</h3>
    <p>There is no live data on how many nurses are currently working in the UK however every nurse (and midwife) need
      to
      be registered in the Nurses and Midwives Council (NMC) to have a right to practice.
      <br>Every Year NMC releases the report showing the size of the register, the number of joiners and leavers during
      that time and a breakdown of the register by age and field of practice.
      This does not mean that all registrants are currently working as registered nurses. </p>

          <h4>Total number of Nurses And Midwives
          </h4>
          <p>There is a slight increase in a number of nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK, with a total of
            693618 people in 2018 compared with 689738 people in 2017. </p>

          <p>The total number of first joiners continues to fall, with the lowest number since 2014.
            <br>
            For the second succeeding year, the number of leavers is larger than the number of joiners. However, in
            comparison to 2017, the number of leavers decreased by 5577 in 2018.

    <h3>Age profile of the register</h3>
    <div class="explore-age">
      <div class="explore">
        <p>The two largest age groups on the register are people aged 41â€“50 and aged 51-60. Together these two age
          groups
          account for 55 percent of the total register.
          <br>
          Increases to the over 50 age bracket could be linked to changes in the wider UK workforce, where the number of
          older workers is growing.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Although the total number of nurses increased slightly, in the last two years the number of nurses flowing out
      of
      the
      system exceeded those coming into the system. Also, because of Brexit and uncertainty around it, the number of
      nurses coming from the EU decreased dramatically.
      At the same time, due to the growing elderly population and a rising number of people with
      multiple long-term illnesses the demand for care is increasing.
